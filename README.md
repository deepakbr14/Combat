# Combat

This python project is an example of how to use the 3D game engine Retro3D. It's a basic clone of the arcade game BattleZone. This game will show you how to handle camera rotation, model loading, sound, music, player input, and 2D HUD graphics.

To run it from the command line use something like  
```python main.py```

If you get an error like:  
Traceback (most recent call last):  
File "main.py", line 1, in  
from Retro3D import *  
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Retro3D'  

it means you need to install Retro3D

Try this:  
```pip install Retro3D```

or this:  
    * terminal to the directory that has the file **`requirements.txt`**  
    * ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
